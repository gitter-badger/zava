``zava`` rocks!

Massive and high-dimensional numerical (or continuous) data may visualized using parallel coordinates. For a technical discussion of parallel coordinates see :cite:`1990:wegman`. In parallel coordinates, axes are drawn parallel to one another (`as opposed to drawn orthogonal to one another`). A vector (or row) of data, :math:`(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)`, is plotted by drawing :math:`x_1` on ``axis 1``, :math:`x_2` on ``axis 2``, and so on through :math:`x_n` on ``axis n``. The plotted points are joined by a broken line. The use of parallel coordinates to visualize massive and high-dimensional data is often a first step in exploratory data analysis ``EDA`` where one may wish to visually identify patterns, clusters, or outliers. Towards the purpose of EDA, a generalized rotation of the coordinate axes in high-dimensional space, referred to as the ``Grand Tour`` :cite:`2002:wegman`, may be used in combination with hue and saturation brushing techniques :cite:`1996:wegman`.
