Massive and high-dimensional numerical (or continuous) data may visualized using parallel coordinates. For a technical discussion of parallel coordinates see :cite:`1990:wegman`. In parallel coordinates, axes are drawn parallel. A vector (or row) of data, (x1, x2, â€¦, xn), is plotted by drawing x1 on axis 1, x2 on axis 2, and so on through xn on axis n. The plotted points are joined by a broken line. The use of parallel coordinates to visualize massive and high-dimensional data is often a first step in exploratory data analysis (EDA) where one may wish to visually identify patterns, clusters, or outliers. Towards the purpose of EDA, a generalized rotation of the coordinate axes in high-dimensional space, referred to as the grand tour :cite:`2002:wegman`, may be used in combination with hue and saturation brushing techniques :cite:`1996:wegman`.
